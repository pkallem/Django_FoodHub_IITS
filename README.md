# FoodHub

During my 7 month internship as a full-stack web application developer at IITS, this was my final solo-project that was scheduled to be implemented by local food vendors. This app is a multi-restaurant platform similar to Grubhub and Uber Eats, allowing local restaurants to create accounts and sell their items using the web application. The project is created using Django, a python-based framework, to handle the back-end.
